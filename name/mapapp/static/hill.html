   <h1>HILL</h1> 
   <p>Arunachala Hills is a sacred, isolated mountain in Tiruvannamalai, Tamil Nadu, South India, revered as a manifestation of Lord Shiva and a symbol of fire and wisdom. Geologically ancient and a focal point for Shaivite spirituality, it features hermitages, springs, and forests and is central to the Arunachaleswarar Temple. The annual circumambulation of the hill, known as Girivalam, is a significant pilgrimage, and the mountain's deep mystical quality has attracted many sages, including Sri Ramana Maharshi</p>
