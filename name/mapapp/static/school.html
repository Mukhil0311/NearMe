    <h1>SCHOOL</h1>
    <p>A school is an institution for learning and instruction, primarily for children and adolescents, led by teachers who guide students through various subjects like reading, writing, and mathematics. Schools can be public or private, government-run or independent, and are often a part of a formal, compulsory education system. Beyond classrooms, ideal schools provide safe, comfortable infrastructure, access to resources like libraries and labs, and opportunities for physical development through sports and activities.  </p>
