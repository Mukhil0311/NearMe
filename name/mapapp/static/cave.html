    <h1>CAVE</h1>
    <p>A cave is a natural underground hollow space or opening in the earth large enough for human entry, formed by processes like dissolving rock (solution caves) or volcanic activity. Caves vary in size and complexity, featuring passageways and chambers and can contain rock formations like stalactites and stalagmites. They serve as habitats for specialized animals and have historically provided shelter and art for people, with the scientific study of caves called speleology</p>
